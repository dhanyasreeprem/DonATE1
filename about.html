          <h2> Done with a late night party? Event? Hackathon? Have Food Leftover? Using DonATE, you can find the nearest homeless shelter or food bank to donate your food.</h2>
          <p> Some 795 million people in the world do not have enough food to lead a healthy active life. That's about one in nine people on earth. The vast majority of the world's hungry people live in developing countries, where 12.9 percent of the population is undernourished. Around the world, a lack of food is a debilitating, often fatal problem. Nearly one in nine people worldwide are chronically undernourished, and 3.1 million children younger than 5 die of malnutrition each year.
As terrible as that problem is, however, there are signs that things may be getting better.

 This week, the International Food Policy Research Institute, Welthungerhilfe and Concern Worldwide released their annual Global Hunger Index (GHI), an overview of the problem of hunger in developing countries. The GHI uses four component indicators — the percentage of the population that is undernourished, the percentage of children who suffer from wasting, the percentage of children who suffer from stunting and the percentage of children younger than 5 who die —to assign a score to each country for which it can get data. The scores correspondent with ratings, which range from “low” to “extremely alarming.”  Forty-four countries have a “serious” level of hunger, while eight have an “alarming” level. In the Central African Republic, the country with the highest GHI, almost 48 percent of the population is undernourished and 40 percent of children younger than 5 have stunted growth. With all the food we are wasting from all the evnts etc., we can give it to the homeless or the food bank who can help reduce the number of people impacted by hunger and malnutrition.
